# OpenSCAD file for doorman project

This is the first 3D printed part I have designed. [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org) is text-based 3D CAD software aimed at programmers.

## what/why?

This part wraps my doorknob and allows the attachment of a stepper motor to control the lock.

This is part of a home automation project with the goal of keyless entry into my 1980's apartment building.

Check out [the blog post I wrote about this part of the process](https://jeremypoole.ca/posts/).
